# Parkisons-Disease-XGBoost
In this Python machine learning project, using the Python libraries scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, I built a model using an XGBClassifier. Iâ€™ll load the data, get the features and labels, scale the features, then split the dataset, build an XGBClassifier, and then calculate the accuracy of our model.
